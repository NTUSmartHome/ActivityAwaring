# Thesis

Hi, This project is for my master thesis.

I'm going to build a system that can awaring human activity from our lab's smart home.

The setting of smart home of this project is using simulation scenario, and I will connect the real smart home in the future.

The wearable data are collected from zen watch with its accelerometer sensor and gyroscope.

This system is only a experimental activity awaring system, so it's not suitable for general usage.

Thanks,
Chen
